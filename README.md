# basic-redux
A super basic redux app.

Clone this project, and point a web server at public/.

This app has a single action, a matching reducer, and a container.

To make changes, run `npm install`, then you can run `npm run dev` to set Webpack to watch for changes, or `npm run build` to build once.

I followed the main body of instructions from this article: [Setting Up a React.js Environment Using Npm, Babel 6 and Webpack](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack) to setup Webpack and Babel.
